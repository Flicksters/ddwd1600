                <p>This website is mostly created as a way to promote and infrom people about the topic of Affliction clothing, and its different brands as a whole.

                <p>Often times teeenagers, usually younger teens, see the harder side of not being able to "fit in" or find the clothing that they feel the most comfortable and themselves wearing.

It is an easy style to be able to find so many different inspirations and outlooks on.</p>
