                <h1>About us</h1>
                <p>This website is mostly created as a way to promote and infrom people about the topic of Affliction clothing, and its different brands as a whole. Here we will show off the different types of shirts made in affliction type styles, the meida and content of differnet accessories and clothing types cirlcling the clothing, etc. This site wont sell the clothing, excpet just direct you, and tell you that this type of clothing exsists, and that it might be fun to look into and get invested in.</p>
                <p>Often times teeenagers, usually younger teens, see the harder side of not being able to "fit in" or find the clothing that they feel the most comfortable and themselves wearing. Since affliction is a style mostly targetted towards teeangers, such has highschoolers, skaters, or sometimes even Junior high and middle schoolers. It is an easy style to be able to find so many different inspirations and outlooks on.</p>
