                <h1>The History Of Affliction.</h1>
                </div>
                <p>The style <strong>Affliction</strong> was first created in 2005 by Courtney Dubar, Todd Beard, Eric Foss and Clifton Chason. They made a website called "Affliction Clothing".</p>
                    <p>Affliction clothing then moved onto making more brands of clothing under their name.</p> 
                
                    <ul>
                            <li> Xtreme Couture</li>
                            <li>American fighters</li>
                            <li>Rebel Saints</li>
                            <li>Sinful</li>
                            <li>Throwdown</li>
                    </ul>
            
                <p>The idea of Affliction first sparked as the founders just having some fun. they describe it as being able to desgin a whole shirt filled with art, instead of just one with some random graphic desgin pattern or saying on it. The shirts are described as unique and self proclaiming. Affliction shirts do not follow the normal rules of printing either, with regualr printing of a shirt you just screen press it and then you are finished. However, a ton of detail and effort is put into these types of cloting to bring off the dare devil, skater kid kind of vibes that they have been know for the past 19 years. </p>
                <p>Affliction as a whole is more represented by the "rebilious" and intructe looking desgins. Often <a href="shirts.html#sign">Affliction shirts</a> have representations of angel wings or skulls.</p>
                <p>Now a days, in the 2020's, Affliction is more seen as a 'Skater boy/girl" type of style. While its big hit was back in the early 2000's, the style is still alive, mostly as a result of passed down clothing or fashion trends amoungst teens.</p>
